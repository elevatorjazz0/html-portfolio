    <h1>Elevator Jazz's Movie Recommendations!</h1>
<h2>Some movie recommendations from your one and only.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Whiplash.</h3>
<p>Love everyhting about this movie. The acting, cinematography, story, the jazz etc. Sick movie!<br />
    My absolute favorite movie of all time.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Nayattu.</h3>
<p>A Malayalam movie that is gross, intense and thrilling.
    Filled with an array of great actors,<br />
    great cinematography and great screenplay,
    this movie is a treat to watch!
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.</h3>
<p>One of the few times I've been amazed by a Bollywood movie is Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara!<br />
    An amazing movie about friendship, love and everything in between. And, the soundtrack<br />
    is absolutely gorgeous and, in my opinion, clears any commercial music that is
    released for<br />
    movies now-a-days.
